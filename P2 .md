Interview Questions:

In an e-commerce or web development-related interview, it is most probable to face the following questions: Describe your educational background. Describe your professional experiences working in e-commerce. Have you ever owned and operated your own e-commerce store? What first interested you about e-commerce? Describe the e-commerce brands you have managed.

**User Experience (UX) Survey Questions**:

UX Survey: It's for gaining insights from users. Some relevant questions will be: How easy was the navigation of our website during your shopping experience? Have you faced any issues while searching for products? And are you satisfied with the checkout process?

**Observation Questions:**

Observations can lead to rich data. For example: What observations techniques are you using to study e-commerce behavior (e.g. participant observation, naturalistic observation)? How have you defined e-commerce? What customer experience strategies have worked for you?


**5.1 Current Business Process (Scenarios, Workflow)**

**Scenarios:**

**Customer Order Processing:**

1.  Customer places an order via the online platform.
2.  The system checks inventory for the requested items.
3.  If items are in stock, the system processes the payment.
4.  An order confirmation is sent to the customer.
5.  The warehouse is notified to prepare the order for shipment.
6.  The order is shipped, and a shipping confirmation is sent to the customer.

**Inventory Management:**

1.  Inventory levels are monitored in real-time.
2.  When stock levels fall below a predefined threshold, a restock order is generated.
3.  The warehouse receives new stock and updates the inventory levels in the system.

**Customer Support:**

1.  Customers can submit support tickets via the online platform.
2.  Support tickets are logged and assigned to a support agent.
3.  The support agent resolves the issue and updates the ticket status.
4.  The customer is notified of the resolution.

**Workflow:**

**Order Processing Workflow:**

1.  **Start:** Customer places an order.
2.  **Check Inventory:** System verifies stock availability.
3.  **Payment Processing:** System processes the payment.
4.  **Order Confirmation:** System sends confirmation to the customer.

Part 6-

Requirement analysis for building a shopping website involves several key steps to ensure the final product meets the needs of users and stakeholders. Here's a summary of the process:

**1. Identify Stakeholders**

-   **Who:** Determine all parties interested in the project, including business owners, customers, developers, and administrators.
-   **Why:** Understand their needs, expectations, and constraints.

**2. Gather Requirements**

-   **Methods:** Use interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observation to collect information.
-   **Types of Requirements:**

-   **Functional Requirements:** Features like user registration, product search, shopping cart, payment gateway integration, order tracking, etc.
-   **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, scalability, security, usability, and reliability.

**3. Analyze Requirements**

-   **Prioritize:** Classify requirements into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won’t-haves (MoSCoW method).
-   **Feasibility Study:** Assess the technical, operational, and economic feasibility of the requirements.
-   **Risk Analysis:** Identify potential risks and their mitigation strategies.

**4. Document Requirements**

-   **Requirement Specification:** Create detailed documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) outlining all functional and non-functional requirements.
-   **Use Cases:** Develop use case diagrams and descriptions to illustrate how users will interact with the system.

**5. Validate Requirements**

-   **Review Sessions:** Conduct walkthroughs and reviews with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
-   **Prototyping:** Build prototypes to validate the look and feel, and usability of the system with stakeholders.

**6. Manage Requirements**

-   **Traceability:** Maintain a traceability matrix to track the origin and status of each requirement.
-   **Change Management:** Establish a process for handling changes to the requirements after the initial analysis.

**Deliverables**

-   **SRS Document:** Comprehensive document detailing all requirements.
-   **Use Case Diagrams:** Visual representations of user interactions.
-   **Feasibility Report:** Analysis of feasibility and risks.
-   **Prototype:** Initial mock-up of the website for validation purposes.

**Conclusion**

This systematic approach to requirement analysis ensures that the shopping website is built to meet user needs, adheres to constraints, and is delivered on time and within budget. Effective communication with stakeholders throughout the process is crucial for success.
